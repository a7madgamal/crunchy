    "description": "Garden is a Kubernetes testing platform for every step of the development process. The widespread adoption of cloud native technologies such as containers and Kubernetes has made it easier than ever to operate and scale applications. But important developer workflows have been overlooked or neglected along the way. Many developers find that they’re now less productive than they were before the cloud native era. Testing is a critical part of the development process and one that’s in need of a major upgrade. Modern cloud native testing practices are largely driven by what’s feasible rather than what’s useful. Developers working on distributed microservices applications have been left without an efficient way to build, run tests, and troubleshoot in a production-like environment. Garden makes it easy to spin up ephemeral testing and preview environments for integration tests, manual QA, and development. With Garden, developers get fast feedback exactly when they need it, and DevOps teams are no longer bogged down with provisioning and managing ad hoc environments. The open source Garden Core is available on GitHub: https://github.com/garden-io/garden We also offer a fully supported enterprise edition: https://garden.io/product/",

Axel Springer founded the publishing house in Hamburg in 1946; the editors spent the first year working above a warehouse for tea and spices, often without electricity, and using borrowed typewriters. As a result of consistent internationalization and digitization, Axel Springer SE today is not only market leader in the German print business, but is also active in more than 40 countries through subsidiaries, joint ventures and licenses. Now it is a question of pressing ahead with digitization even faster and more vigorously. For Axel Springer SE, informative and entertaining journalism is a viable business model also in future on the Internet, along with marketing and classifieds, the other two business segments in which the company is traditionally strong. In the tradition of its founder, who fostered journalistic and technological innovations in his time, Axel Springer SE is breaking new ground. The company is consistently pursuing the objective of building up a fast-growing and profitable digital portfolio and for this reason is networking today more than ever before with the current generation of founders: digital start-ups. Along with the transformation of their established strong media brands, their own new developments online and strategically-oriented acquisitions of web companies, this network is one of the building blocks of the company's international digitization strategy: Axel Springer SE wants to become the leading digital publisher.",

    "shortDescription": "Enpal is a photovoltaics leasing firm that provides solar power systems for homeowners.",
    "description": "Enpal is a Berlin-based company that provides all-in-one renewable energy solutions consisting of solar panels, battery, wallbox, heat pump and energy management system for customers across Germany and Italy. Founding and early history Enpal was founded in 2017 by Mario Kohle, Jochen Ziervogel, and Viktor Wingert. The company received early backing from Lukasz Gadowski, the prominent entrepreneur and venture capitalist, and several board members of the Zalando fashion conglomerate. Enpal’s co-founders initially developed a sales-based business model, where end-users could purchase PV systems. Early market research suggested that a lease model would attract more uptake from customers who didn’t want the hassle of high investment costs and maintaining the solar system by themselves. The company settled on a 20-year lease term, which proved wildly successful during the first few years of its existence. Its lease agreements require no upfront payment from the customer and include installation, insurance, maintenance and other services. Rapid growth and expansion For most of its history, Enpal focused on the German market, first around its hometown of Berlin and later throughout the whole country. During the late 2010s and early 2020s, the company opened several satellite offices in an effort to provide responsive, localized sales and service to customers across the country. In 2021, Enpal opened a state-of-the-art training center for solar PV installers, where it trains its rapidly growing team of craftsmen. The company now has more than 200 local installer teams, whose members make up the bulk of Enpal’s employee roster, and a robust, efficient supply chain. Enpal’s key backers have included major impact investors and climate-tech venture firms, including Princeville Climate Technologies, Softbank Vision Fund II, TPG Rise Climate, HV Capital, The Westly Group, and Activate Capital. Co-founder Mario Kohle remains a managing director of the company. Fellow co-founders Jochen Ziervogel and Viktor Wingert (the current Chief Investment Officer) remain deeply involved as well. Enpal has won a number of awards over the years, including first place in the German Sustainability Prize Next Economy Award 2022, first place in the 2023 Smart Home Germany Awards, a 2023/2024 Stern Companies of the Future award, Die Welt #1 Service Champion in Customer Service Award, and KfW Award for Entrepreneurs 2022. The Enpal app was also awarded as Germany’s best solar management app. The company has also been among Germany’s fastest-growing companies in 2022 and 2023 based on the FT1000 ranking. Enpal today Today, Enpal has installed more than 60,000 solar PV systems across Germany and Italy. As of late 2022, Enpal is recognized as the market leader for solar PV installations in Germany. The company’s 2022 revenues exceeded 400 million euros on a headcount of more than 1,000 employees. After pivoting away from the sales model and focusing on leased systems for most of its history, Enpal added back a sales option in 2023 to accommodate customers who want to buy their solar solution. Either model can save the customer tens of thousands of euros over the course of a system’s 20- to 25-year useful lifespan, according to company data. Enpal has also diversified its product offerings in recent years. It now offers all-in-one renewable energy solutions consisting of solar panels, battery, wallbox, heat pump and energy management system.",

With digital tools for laboratories, it increases productivity and improves efficiency in laboratories.

The digital connectivity of laboratories and innovative data management is a focus topic in industry and research. In a fragmented landscape of high-tech equipment and specialized software, Labforward links data silos and helps to eliminate costly and error-prone data transfers. Based on this horizontal connectivity, the software Laboperator enables the remote control and monitoring of laboratory equipment, the integration of LIMS systems, databases and special software as well as the automation of workflows. The Labfolder data platform aggregates both automatically recorded and manually added data and enables the review, sharing, retrieval and validation of data by means of a collaborative ELN. Whether life sciences, chemical synthesis, analytics, quality control or research and development: no matter how specific the field or task of a laboratory may be, the way it works and the requirements for data management have a common core. Labforward focuses on this core.",

A company could simply enforce stricter travel policies to make employees travel greener in alignment with its climate targets. But why enforcing if same results can be achieved by guidance? We are building a comprehensive solution by empowering business travelers to make conscious choices. Instead of booking as if ‘on autopilot’ and mindless of travel budgets and environmental impacts, our gamification model motivates travelers to voluntarily reduce their carbon footprint and spending on business trips. Our unique software can be seamlessly integrated into customers’ existing travel booking systems and is backed by a customizable algorithm. Travel alternatives that are cheaper and more CO2-efficient than the typical default option are highlighted in the booking system with attractive incentives guiding employees to choose more consciously.

They do this by providing real-time insights on business calls for managers on one side, and supporting agents with continuous communication training on the job on the other. i2x enables companies to leverage data and understand what makes their team successful and customers happy - all in real-time and powered by AI. With i2x, the black box of phone calls is decrypted for the first time. Traditionally, contact center success metrics are based on a limited set of data, including call attempts and duration. Built on a fit-for-purpose ASR (automatic speech recognition), i2x opens the doors to deeper, more meaningful insights. The platform evaluates complex speech parameters in real-time to determine the dynamics of a customer conversation. This includes customizable words and phrases, pauses, rate of speech, and speech-to-listen ratio. i2x analyzes sales and service team calls and identifies which approach works best for a specific customer or prospect group. Data-driven best practices are automatically shared with all team members. As a result, managers gain deeper insights into customer interactions, the skills of existing employees evolve and brand experience improves. i2x makes call data analyzable and actionable. “They do not automate, they augment the human intelligence, elevate customer interactions and amplify sales.”",

    "shortDescription": "We are digital pioneers for scientifically based and practice-proven smart assistance solutions to support the care.",
    "description": "With a smart, adaptive and automated form of data processing and preparation, alea opens the way for future-proof, digitally supported everyday care. As an initial component of the AssistMe care platform, alea enables a contemporary, efficient care data culture for future intersectoral, networked processes and digitally supported teamwork. In the end, the aim is to effectively support care in times of a shortage of skilled workers through more self-determined content transparency - with complete personal autonomy and freedom of action and less redundancy & stress. Elderly Care will struggle in the next 10 years due to an increasing ageing population, fewer caregivers, more workload, stress, and manual documentation. All of that is a problem for the well-being of those in need of care. Furthermore, the incontinence management means large time and material expenses for caregivers. With the joint system, both companies can equip over 80 % of care recipients in care homes. An initial scientific study proved that the system could save 23 % of adult diapers and time while changing them. Together with significantly fewer leakages, the caregiver can reinvest the time gained in even higher quality care work. This ultimately has the potential to benefit care recipients in terms of quality of sleep and life. Digital functions for optimized care processes With a very new smart sensor strip, we made leading quality adult diaper brands compatible with the digital possibilities of intelligent care technology of alea. The system reveals where care needs exist, but are not immediately visible, e.g. the urine status in the adult diaper which previously was not known until manually checked. The system transforms this initially hidden care and health data and converts it into digital, structured, immediately understandable real-time information for elderly care and its relevant stakeholders. All functionalities are based on the device alea sensor clip on smart Diaper products, which can be attached and changed in seconds. With just one quick click, caregivers turn the smart diaper into a ready-to-use digital care assistance system. With an optimal sensor position in the centre of the adult diaper and without direct skin contact. The alea hardware can generate highly valid information and make it available to care staff in real time through the mobile and web apps. The care-relevant information of alea includes the amount of urine, movements in the care bed for effective pressure ulcer prevention, fall detection and zone management. How caregivers, care homes & care recipients benefit Over 80 % of care home residents suffer from incontinence. This is a major challenge for everyone involved. The smart system solves issues for all care related audiences: Care recipients benefit from less time in full incontinence pads, but also benefit from fewer manual visual checks during bedtimes. In addition, there is a higher level of safety and prevention. By reducing time-consuming routine and visual checks on an as-needed basis. Caregivers can invest the time gained in other important or relevant care tasks. In this way, they can increase their self-determination in their work and thus their job satisfaction. Thanks to the significant savings in materials and costs, care home operators gain more planning security and can focus their business value creation even better on direct care for people in need of care. In this way, care homes can position themselves as more attractive employers for care staff because they have state-of-the-art digital equipment. With the Care. For the Care. The solution was developed and tested together with the care practice. With the IoT and future-proof platform approach, caregivers will benefit from additional functions in an established and accepted product setting. The system can be connected to various care documentation systems via open interfaces. The aim of the solution is not only to reduce the workload for all those involved in care. Care homes can also optimize teamwork and automate routine processes to support caregivers in the interests of people-centric care in the face of an increasing shortage of skilled staff. With the market entry, care homes can obtain information and order from us or one of our partners. While they order smart Diapers from our partners in the unit price context they are used to, alea Digital System comes as a software-as-a-service model. Without any additional initial costs, they can use all functions via personally provided hardware and software for each care recipient – for the most cost-efficient and needs-orientated use.",

    "description": "The idea for the company came about during a visit to a family celebration in a small village in Franconia. Virtually everyone there generates green electricity. But strangely enough, you could not buy the electricity anywhere, and it was often dependent on non-transparent offers. They thought that an approach that has worked well for food for years should actually work even better for regional electricity. That idea sparked the development of their software, which uses sophisticated algorithms to ensure a secure and balanced supply of green electricity in regional communities. The software has been operational and available on the market since the beginning of 2014. They have already implemented many projects with municipal utilities, project developers, energy cooperatives and new energy players - initially with the approach of introducing regional electricity products. And in 2016, they developed their software into a “utility in a box” solution and can now offer all the services of an energy service provider in a modular and highly automated way.",

    "shortDescription": "We pioneer the road freight industry’s transformation towards greater efficiency, supply chain transparency and environmental sustainability",
    "description": "The road freight industry is the backbone of our economy with continuously growing volumes of goods transported by trucks. But it is also responsible for 6% of the European CO2 emissions. Despite the fact that fuel consumption accounts for more than 30% of the costs of a truck fleet operator, fuel management and optimization is often neglected because of missing transparency. Tracks is a Berlin-based startup founded in 2018 aiming to make road freight more efficient, safer, cleaner and fairer. After starting off with the advances of platooning, our team now leverages the power of artificial intelligence and big data to help the industry reduce their environmental footprint and increase efficiency. Thereby we are getting closer to our vision of a future powered by sustainable freight transport. We use artificial intelligence to analyze fleet performance to provide fleet owners of any size with real-time performance analytics to empower road freight companies to increase fuel efficiency to reduce their energy consumption and ecological footprint. This includes advanced performance analysis of single vehicles, transparent efficiency comparison between vehicles and recommendations tools with actionable insights to increase efficiency of their fleets and help them make better decisions , all in a single-view dashboard. This significantly improves the customers’ bottom line and strengthens their competitive advantage in the market. Furthermore, Tracks enables effective CO2 emissions management to increase transparency and sustainability for shippers. This includes automated carrier emissions reporting, transparent overview of their performance and advanced performance analysis of single vehicles. A win-win for shippers and their road freight carriers. https://youtu.be/UaLGUJhVHcs?t=1502",

Spreadsheets are used in almost every company to run calculations, define logic and solve problems. But they were not designed to integrate with modern software development processes. In fact, as a developer, spreadsheets can be a real pain to work with. We've experienced the challenges of using spreadsheets in software firsthand. In our previous startups we frequently tried to integrate spreadsheet capabilities in SaaS, but found it to be incredibly difficult. The lack of modern, high-performing spreadsheet tech with a great developer experience, ultimately led to us creating our own spreadsheet tooling: EqualTo Sheets. By offering spreadsheet tech that developers love, our mission is to enable closer collaboration between engineering teams and spreadsheet users, which ultimately will lead to better software.",

BEAD analysis learns from the building and its users and is empowered to start taking over the most intelligent operation of the building. The building will not only be a smart building but also a building operated by artificial intelligence based on ever-improving, anonymised data. It controls automation and redirects energy to be used where and when it is needed. Its logic builds on the idea that buildings are dynamic entities and should be treated more like living and learning organisms and not like static dumb assets. Today, they give the opportunity to commercial buildings owners who don't know how they consume energy to connect with the buildings life cycle in order to save energy and cost while getting the same level of quality as up to now via operating the buildings with BEADs' AI. With the help of BEAD the buildings will have a smart energy agent that works and operates the building 7/24. BEAD furthermore analyses how commercial buildings consume energy according to human behavior, occupancy ratios and ambiance and environmental changes in the building in order to give real-time feedback to the automation system. BEAD is the first step to AI operated learning buildings that can adapt themselves operating with real time feedback loops in order to save energy without losing comfort and sustainability",

    "description": "EFFICIENT - SCALABLE - EVERYWHERE MOWEA sets new standards in energy supply by wind power. Today, there is no scalable and efficient use of wind power with flexible application possibilities that can be installed and maintained easily and cost-effectively. We are rethinking the concept of wind power for both urban and industrial applications. The use of modular and scalable wind energy systems based on the Lego Principle offers every customer flexible and efficient wind energy. Thanks to the latest high-tech technology, our wind systems are efficient, flexible and scalable due to the innovation of modularity. In addition, our systems can be easily installed on industrial plants, buildings or open spaces for B2B2C applications. Our wind turbines are IoT compatible, for better control, optimized safety or outstanding design features. THE CHALLENGE OF GREEN POWER GENERATION AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL DILEMMA Above all, the production and energy consumption of fossil fuels cause environmentally harmful emissions that have a direct and indirect negative impact on our climate. The solution is to reward environmentally-friendly activities, especially by industry and businesses, and to make climate-damaging practices more expensive. Renewable energy generation for personal use is an important driver of the Green Tech megatrends or Smart Energy​ because the energy generated is easy to install and maintain on the one hand and on the other hand inexpensive and flexible. In addition, energy efficiency is to be further increased through IoT approaches and intelligent communication interfaces. **** MOWEA is your expert for wind energy and small wind energy, green tech and approval procedures, reliable implementation and maintenance. Your climate contribution through MOWEA's modular small wind energy solutions makes you self-sufficient and offers you energy and cost-efficiency. **** READY TO TALK?",

    "description": "Factory develops and operates offices for fast growing startups and technology companies. Their model focuses on clustering successful startups, international tech giants and young entrepreneurs in sizable office complexes to facilitate exchange, shared knowledge and provide the framework for serendipity to take place. The Factory concept originated in Berlin in early 2012 as a response to the dire need for flexible contracts for office space from technology startups, doubling in size sometimes inside 12 months. Understanding the specific growth trends and needs for tech-focused firms, their spaces and rental contracts are designed to support the individual phases of their development. Beyond well designed, flexible office space, Factory’s cluster model creates proximity and allows like-minded companies to network, host events together and ultimately build meaningful partnerships and relationships with one another. The environment they strive for on their campuses is open and collaborative – where all parties are supporting each other along their growth trajectory. They have defined six elements at the core of the Factory model: Community, Technology, Events, Partnerships, Communication and Space. While it is intrinsic for the startup community to be open and share with one another, often other actors within society have difficulty in finding an inroad. Factory offers access by the established industry, academia and politicians through a physical manifestation of a city’s technology community.",

    "description": "Fraugster is a German-Israeli anti-fraud company that uses artificial intelligence to eliminate fraud and increase customers’ profits. Fraugster's journey began in 2014 with the vision to design and build an anti-fraud technology that can help create a fraud free world - one where no one has to care about managing risk again. After years of working in the payments industry, the founders experienced first-hand the challenges of fraud for e-commerce merchants. The founders discovered that all existing anti-fraud solutions were built on outdated technologies and therefore not good enough to deal with sophisticated cyber criminals. Existing rule-based systems as well as classical machine learning solutions are expensive and can't adapt to new fraud patterns in real-time, hence inaccurate.",

The idea of the DriveMining project was born in Berlin in 2017 and since then, our team of skilled and enthusiastic engineers has created a sustainable and efficient mobile mining system that can be installed in existing vehicles and generate additional revenue for the company. It utilizes existing infrastructure, requires no additional investment and carries much less risk compared to traditional mining farms, due to the fragmentation of mining units. Our DriveMiner can switch between 11 different types of crypto currencies and is able to adapt to different measurement or communication devices, providing the basis for future projects in mobile data collection. DriveMining aims to support environmental protection projects with data by collecting a wide variety of environmental information, regardless of location or vehicle type.",

While hazelnuts are typically regarded as a by-product of the chocolate industry, we give them the love and attention they deserve. Northern Anatolian tombul hazelnuts are considered the best in the world, and only the best of the best make it into CRAVERS. 70% of the world's hazelnuts come from Northern Anatolia, Turkey, and we've been snacking on this great nut since we were kids. The tradition is much older than us; hazelnuts have been grown in this part of the world for more than 2,000 years. Our local manufacturing partner was founded by four sisters, underlining the importance of women in both decision-making and production. Women make up more than 80% of their workforce, and we are proud to contribute to their mission.",
