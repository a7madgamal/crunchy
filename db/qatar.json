    "shortDescription": "Social network, web3, AI, social media, blockchain, token",
    "description": "A decentralized social network for Muslims leveraging token economy for enhanced community experience Highlights: A Sharia-compliant social network designed for Muslims and people of traditional views Umma Life includes various built-in products and features such as Umma Marketplace, Umma Education, Umma.Nikah (marriage agency) and more UMMA Token, a cryptocurrency that supports the Umma Life ecosystem. It can be earned for active actions and used for various purposes such as promoting content, advertising, and more Introduction: Umma Life is an Islamic social network that connects Muslims from around the world. It is designed to be a comprehensive online community based on the principles of Islamic law, with a variety of features including news, information, a mosque directory, a marketplace for Islamic goods and services, and more. The social network is moderated to ensure that all content aligns with Islamic values. Problem Statement: Conventional social networks, dating services, and digital currencies often promote and allow the sharing of content and values that are in direct conflict with Islamic principles and beliefs. For example, many of these platforms encourage extramarital relationships, which is strictly forbidden in Islam. Furthermore, conventional social networks may not have proper mechanisms in place to filter out or restrict access to content that is deemed offensive or inappropriate according to Islamic teachings. This can lead to Muslims being exposed to harmful or inappropriate material, further compounding the issue. Given these challenges, it is important for Muslims to seek out alternative platforms that align with their beliefs and values. These platforms should prioritize the protection and promotion of Islamic principles, while also offering features and services that are in line with the teachings of Islam. Solution: Umma Life provides a safe and secure platform that is based on Sharia principles and prohibits content that contradicts Islamic values.This platform serves as the foundation of the UmmaLife ecosystem, and allows users to connect, share, and engage with each other. It includes a social network, a marketplace, education platform, marriage agency and a cryptocurrency, UMMA Token, which helps to create a self-sufficient ecosystem within the social network. The solution consists of several key components that work together within the UmmaLife ecosystem: Umma Marketplace marketplace is designed to support the halal economy and promote entrepreneurship within the Muslim community Umma Education provides users with the opportunity to organize and participate in online learning Umma.Nikah is designed to promote the idea of a halal and moral relationship and is based on Sharia principles. UMMA Token: UMMA Token is an important component of the Umma Life ecosystem and can be used for a variety of purposes, including promoting content, purchasing goods and services in the marketplace, investing in the platform, and more. Tokens can also be earned through active engagement on the social network, such as creating and uploading content, commenting, and reporting prohibited content. Token Utility: The UMMA Token is designed to support and stimulate the growth of the Umma Life ecosystem. It can be used for: Premium account and verification Upcoming: Promoting stories, videos, podcasts, and other content. Targeted advertising Purchasing goods and services in the marketplace. Supporting and promoting a user's profile in the marriage agency. Remittance and transferring currency within the social network. Voting for user publications through donations of tokens. Earning tokens through active engagement on the social network.",

    "description": "At-Home-Doc offers a comprehensive yet outreach primary healthcare medical service platform that utilizes the latest state-of-the-art and bespoke healthcare technologies in providing a patient-centric, world-class, and evidence-based medical practice. The service is provided by “Medihealth Solutions Pty Ltd”, Australia, which is a leading and emerging fast-paced and forward-thinking company. AT-HOME-DOC offers the convenience of seeing a highly qualified, experienced, and accredited doctor without the need to leave your premises. Their doctors are on the road and ready to attend to patients’ premises; providing the best care, after conducting a systematic thorough examination, and complying with international standards; that is a subject of constant auditing and supervision by our Chief Medical Officer. Our Doctors are equipped with all the needed state-of-the-art equipment that guarantees, conducting a comprehensive medical examination. The doctor will be able to provide the patients with the first doses of any prescribed medications. In addition to that, our electronic prescription system will allow you to have your prescribed medications, delivered to your doorstep with clear instructions for administering the correct dosage. Moreover, if the doctors feel that your condition renders you unfit to work or attend the university or school, they will issue your medical certificate and email it after the visit. Shall there be any further investigations required like blood tests etc., our electronic investigation requesting system will organize a booking for the requested test and the laboratory staff will soon get in touch to organize a suitable time, for attending to the patient’s premises and collecting the specimens? Being committed to providing the continuity of medical care, our doctors will check the results and discuss with you the finding during a follow-up phone call, video conference, or a second visit if required. AT-HOME-DOC is not an emergency service; hence, our triage nurses will only take the bookings for the patients that suffer from acute but not emergent medical conditions complying with the company’s policy and divert any emergency to the emergency services, if appropriate. However, our doctor might refer the patient to a hospital, if the doctor suspects any potential risk or confirms any acute emergency that would be deemed unsuitable for home care. Our Doctor will then work with the control tower on organizing the patients’ transfer to the nearest hospital if required. Download our “AT-HOME-DOC” mobile phone app. It makes scheduling or requesting a doctor’s home visit, simple, quick, and easy; you can click to call for immediate assistance or submit an online request. It is your ideal tool, making your access to the itinerary, appointment reminders, and your personal medical records, literally in your hand, at all times!",

    "description": "Gulf-Times Inspired by a sense of patriotism, a group of good citizens of this generous land decided in 1978 to establish the Gulf Publishing & Printing Company. That decision proved to be a turning-point in the literary life of Qatar, leading to the creation of two great newspapers. The Company and its publications are a practical expression of the hopes and aspirations, values and principles of our country and its culture, which are deeply rooted in the Gulf and Arab world. It is fair to say that our Company is a cornerstone of the Qatari information media. Since its inception it has been dedicated to reflecting events at home and abroad. Always, our watchwords have been truth and accuracy. We have opened our columns to debate; offered distinguished journalism and useful information. We conceive our publications as offering a stream of knowledge: artistic, literary, political and financial. They are, we hope, a focal point for thought and culture. We maintain a continuous creative effort to serve the country and its citizens, striving to reach new horizons but approaching that task with responsibility, fairness, balance and honesty.",
